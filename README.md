Create an Kotlin Android application that should render an empty chessboard 
where the user will be able to mark a starting position and an ending position. 
The app should then render a list of all possible paths that one knight (αλογάκι) 
piece in the starting position could take to reach the ending position in N (default 
= 3) moves. Some inputs might not have a solution, in this case the program 
should display a message that no solution has been found.  The user should be 
able to reset the board and start again. How the application will render the paths 
is up to you (e.g. render the paths using lines of different color, present a list of 
the moves in algebraic chess notation, animation of the knight along the path). 
The rendered chessboard could be of any size NxN where   6<=N<=16. The user 
should be able to choose the desire chessboard size. The user should be able to 
choose max moves. The path calculation should not block the main thread. The 
app should ‘remember’ the last possible solution after the app is closed (killed) 
and re-opened.
